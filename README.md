# phpexercise

## Description
This PHP application retrieves data from a JSON API server and displays it on a webpage. This is an exercise, not meant to be used by others as it should theoretically serve them no good.

This exercise uses the PHP cURL library to make an API call to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts, retrieves all the posts available in the resource, and prints out an HTML page into the console as an HTML string. The string contains a table, with rows that correspond to each post's data.

## Instructions
Run `php index.php` to see the HTML string
